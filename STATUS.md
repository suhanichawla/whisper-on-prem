# Whisper Speech App - Fix Status

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES**

### 1. **Missing ffmpeg** ✅
- **Problem**: `Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'`
- **Solution**: Installed ffmpeg via Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`
- **Status**: Fixed and verified working

### 2. **Segmentation Fault** ✅
- **Problem**: `./run.sh: line 17: 99580 Segmentation fault: 11 python main.py`
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive resource cleanup during shutdown causing crashes
- **Solution**: Implemented gentle cleanup strategy:
  - Avoided aggressive PyAudio termination
  - Added proper thread waiting with timeouts
  - Implemented graceful shutdown with signal handlers
  - Removed destructive cleanup from `__del__` methods
- **Status**: Fixed - app now works multiple times without crashes

### 3. **Resource Leaks** ✅
- **Problem**: `resource_tracker: There appear to be 1 leaked semaphore objects`
- **Solution**: Improved thread management and cleanup timing
- **Status**: Significantly reduced resource leaks

### 4. **Error Handling** ✅
- **Problem**: Poor error handling causing crashes
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all critical sections
- **Status**: App now handles errors gracefully

## 🎯 **WORKING FEATURES**

- ✅ **Audio Recording**: PyAudio working properly
- ✅ **Whisper Transcription**: Models load and transcribe successfully
- ✅ **Auto-copy to Clipboard**: Text automatically copies
- ✅ **Auto-paste**: Attempts to paste to active window
- ✅ **Manual Recording**: Test button works reliably
- ✅ **System Tray**: App runs in background
- ✅ **Multiple Uses**: No longer crashes after first use

## ⚠️ **KNOWN ISSUES**

### 1. **Accessibility Permissions**
- **Issue**: `This process is not trusted! Input event monitoring will not be possible`
- **Impact**: Global hotkeys (Fn key) don't work until permissions granted
- **Workaround**: Use manual "Test Recording" button
- **Solution**: Grant permissions in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility

### 2. **FP16 Warning**
- **Issue**: `FP16 is not supported on CPU; using FP32 instead`
- **Impact**: Cosmetic warning only, doesn't affect functionality
- **Status**: Normal behavior for CPU-only systems

## 🚀 **USAGE**

### **Immediate Use (No permissions needed)**
1. Run: `./run.sh`
2. Click and hold "Test Recording" button
3. Speak while holding button
4. Release to transcribe
5. Text auto-copies to clipboard

### **Global Hotkeys (Requires permissions)**
1. Grant accessibility permissions in System Preferences
2. Use Fn key or Cmd+Space while speaking
3. Works from any application

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied**

1. **Gentle Cleanup Pattern**: Avoided aggressive resource termination
2. **Signal Handlers**: Proper SIGINT/SIGTERM handling
3. **Thread Management**: Timeout-based waiting instead of indefinite blocking
4. **Resource Tracking**: Better state management for cleanup
5. **Error Isolation**: Wrapped all critical operations in try-catch
6. **Memory Management**: Strategic use of garbage collection

## 📊 **Test Results**

- ✅ App starts successfully
- ✅ Records audio without errors
- ✅ Transcribes speech accurately
- ✅ Copies to clipboard reliably
- ✅ Handles multiple recording sessions
- ✅ Shuts down gracefully without segfaults
- ✅ Works repeatedly without crashes

## 🎉 **Summary**

The app is now **fully functional** and **stable**. The main recording and transcription features work reliably. Global hotkeys require one-time permission setup, but manual recording works immediately.

**Primary Fix**: Replaced aggressive resource cleanup with gentle cleanup patterns to prevent segmentation faults during shutdown.
